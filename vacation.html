    <h2>History</h2>    
    <p>Today’s visitors to <strong>Greece</strong> have the opportunity to trace the “fingerprints” of Greek history from the Paleolithic Era 
      to the Roman Period in the hundreds of archaeological sites, as well as in the archaeological museums and collections that 
      are scattered throughout the country. The first traces of human habitation in Greece appeared during the Paleolithic Age 
      (approx. 120000 - 10000 B.C.). During the Neolithic Age that followed (approx. 7000 - 3000 B.C.), a plethora of Neolithic 
      buildings spread throughout the country. Buildings and cemeteries have been discovered in Thessaly (Sesklo, Dimini), Macedonia, 
      the Peloponnese, etc. The beginning of the Bronze Age (approx. 3000-1100 B.C.) is marked by the appearance of the first urban 
      centers in the Aegean region (Poliochni on Limnos). Flourishing settlements were found on Crete, Mainland Greece, the Cyclades 
      and the Northeastern Aegean, regions where characteristic cultural patterns developed. At the beginning of the 2nd Millennium B.C., 
      organized palatial societies appeared on Minoan Crete, resulting in the development of the first systematic scripts. The Minoans, 
      with Knossos Palace as their epicenter, developed a communications network with races from the Eastern Mediterranean region, adopted 
      certain elements and in turn decisively influenced cultures on the Greek mainland and the islands of the Aegean. On Mainland Greece, 
      the Mycenean Greeks –taking advantage of the destruction caused on Crete by the volcanic eruption on Santorini (around 1500 B.C.)- 
      became the dominant force in the Aegean during the last centuries of the 2nd Millennium B.C.. The Mycenean acropolises (citadels) 
      in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, Thiva, Glas, Athens and Iolcus, then comprised the centers of the bureaucratically organized kingdoms. 
      The extensive destruction of the Mycenean centers around 1200 B.C. led to the decline of the Mycenean civilization and caused the 
      population to migrate to the coastal regions of Asia Minor and Cyprus (1st Greek colonization).</p>

  <p><strong>Greece</strong> has one of the longest coastlines in the world – almost 16.000km. The mainland and island areas end in a myriad variety of 
    coastlines, with countless beautiful small beaches, charming bays and coves. Half of the aforementioned length includes the thousands 
    of Greek islands scattered through the Greek seas, while the rest extends along the mainland.The Greek shores are world-famous and 
    exceedingly popular because they are known for their crystal clean and clear waters, as well as for their unique diversity. Visitors
